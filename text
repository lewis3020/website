make sure to devide the sides and left and right in to thier own divs 
make them actually show how they would be with the actual computer
left on left right on right and center on center 
also add corresponding text to each new line so people know witch is for witch 
note that it must align with the options it cannot be off to the side \
------
figure out how to move enter and refrest button to middle of the page and that it is centerd correctly
----
make the enter button display text inside of a text box so it can be copied from withing the text box and not have to be highligted 
----
orginise all different options and divs so that it looks somewhat decent ones it is set 
--
fix text opetions to most likely to least likely depending on what comes up most and what comes up least
--
align the options better so it easier to read, also make the checkboxes bigger so its not as hard to make the options
